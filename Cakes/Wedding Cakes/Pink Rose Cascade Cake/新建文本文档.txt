The handmade sugar roses turn this understated yet elegant cascade into a stunning wedding cake. Each rose consists of individual petals carefully hand-moulded from sugar paste ¨C a painstaking process that requires great skill, a steady hand and no small amount of patience.

The flowers are carefully dusted with natural colour to look even more realistic. Each tier is covered in soft icing and trimmed with ribbon for a pretty finish.
