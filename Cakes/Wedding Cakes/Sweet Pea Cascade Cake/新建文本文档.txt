This pretty cake is one of our most popular designs. Its classic style is inspired by 1920s photographs from the days of our founder, Frederick Belmont. Each tier is covered in soft icing then trimmed with narrow ribbon and delicate beadwork.

The handmade sugar flowers are painstakingly moulded and shaped before being wired together, then carefully dusted with a hint of colour to make them look even more realistic..
