The beautiful realistic lilies on this elegant cake add a dramatic finishing touch. Each tier is covered in soft icing then trimmed with narrow ribbon and delicate beadwork.

To make the lilies look so life-like, each petal is individually cut and delicately textured before being hand-dusted with subtle colour.
