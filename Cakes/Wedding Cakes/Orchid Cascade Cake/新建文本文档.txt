An ideal choice if you¡¯re looking for something a little more exotic, the beautiful orchids delicately draped around the cake add a stunning finish. Each elegant tier is covered in soft icing then trimmed with narrow ribbon and delicate beadwork.

The orchid flowers are carefully moulded and shaped before being wired together, then dusted with a hint of colour to make them look almost real.
