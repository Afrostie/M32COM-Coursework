This decidedly different cake is wonderfully unique - and far easier to divide into individual portions! The top tier is covered in sugar paste icing and edged with a handpiped ¡®swag¡¯ design, while a beautiful handmade rose on top adds a finishing touch. Below are layers of individual Fondant Fancies.

Each Fondant Fancy is handmade from light Genoese sponge layered with finest quality marzipan, raspberry preserve and vanilla buttercream. After being coated in fondant icing they are then finished off with three handmade rosebuds to match the larger roses. Other sizes and designs are also available.
