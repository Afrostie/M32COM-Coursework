"This looks more like a panettone than a hot cross bun, but it tastes just as it should and there¡¯s something particularly satisfying about this loaf version, the slices of which are much easier to fit into conventional toasters. Full of flavour, with a decent amount of fruit." As featured in 10 best hot cross buns, independent.co.uk, March 2016
